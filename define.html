            <h1>Definition of Internet of Things</h1>
            <p>The world as we know it is changing day by day. There was a time when all this technology was nothing but a theory. People would dream of making machines that did things for them. However, even in this new era, technology

            <h3>So what is the Internet of Things?</h3>
            <p>The <i>Internet of Things(IoT)</i> is the connection of millions of smart devices and sensors connected to the internet. These devices and sensors collect and share
            data for use and evaluation by many organisations like businesses, cities, governments, hospitals and even individuals. IoT has become one of the most important technologies of the 21st century.
            Now that we can connect everyday objects like kitchen appliances, cars, thermostats and baby monitors to the internet via embedded devices, seamless communication is possible between people, processes and things.</p>
