            <h2>How are IoT devices connected to the Network?</h2>
                <p>Sensors need to be connected to a network in order to gather data and store it and even share it. This can be accomplished through the use of a wireless connection  or a wired Ethernet
                    connection to a controller. <i>Controllers</i> are responsible for collecting data from sensors and providing network or internet connectivity. Depending on how they are programmed, they may make
                    immediate decisions or send the data to a more powerful computer for analysis, which might be in the same network as the controller or might only be accessible through the internet.</p>
                <p>Actuators work together with sensors. They take electrical input and transform it into physical action. For example, if temperature sensors in your house detect a fall in temperature,
                    they may send a signal to the AC and in turn the AC turns on bringing back the temperature in the room to a certain level.</p>
                <p>Consideration must be given to power consumption of the sensors since most of them are 'out in the field'. Low-powered connections must be used to optimise and extend the availability of the sensor.
                    They can be powered either through solar panels or batteries. They can also be powered by the device in which they are attached to.</p>
                <p>Some examples of sensors include: <i>fitness watches, pacemakers, water meters, air meters in mine shafts e.t.c.</i></p>

            <h2>Big Data</h2>
                <h3><i>What is Big Data?</i></h3>
                    <p><i>Data</i> is any information that comes from various sources like people, , sensors, websites and even phones and computers. <i>Big Data</i> is a lot of data. Some characteristics of big data are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>They have a large amount of data that increasingly requires more storage space -> <i>Volume</i></li>
                            <li>The amount of data is growing exponentially fast -> <i>Velocity</i></li>
                            <li>The data is generated in different formats -> <i>Variety</i></li>
                        </ul>
                        Even though big data creates challenges for orgaizations in form of storage and analytics, it also provides invaluable information to fine-tune operations and improve customer satisfaction.</p>

                <h3><i>Challenges of big data</i></h3>
                    <p>There are 5 major data storage problems with big data:
                        <ul>
                            <li><i>Management</i> - A management system must be used to organise and collate all of the sources where data is generated and collected from.</li>
                            <li><i>Security</i> - Data must be kept secure and only accessible by authorized users.</li>
                            <li><i>Redundancy</i> - Processes for backups, redundancy and disaster recovery are required in order to maintain the integrity of the stored data.</li>
                            <li><i>Analytics</i> - Data storage syystems must be able to manage and analyse both types of data, that is unstructured and structerd data. Unstructured data consists of emails and photos, while structured
                                data consists of spreadsheets.</li>
                            <li><i>Access</i> - Data must be accessible from anywhere and at any time.</li>
                        </ul>
                        Companies that deal with big data must take these factors into consideration in order to decide on a suitable data storage facility.</p>

                <h3>The Cloud</h3>
                    <p><i>The cloud</i> is a collection of data centers or groups of connected servers. These servers have softwares, storage and services which can be accessed through the internet. The cloud has many advantages to both
                        individuals and companies/enterprises. For an individual, the cloud allows them to:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Store all their data such as pictures, music and videos therefore freeing up space on their hard drive.</li>
                            <li>Access dmany applications instead of downloading them.</li>
                            <li>Access their data anywhere, anytime and on any device.</li>
                        </ul>
                        Similarly, the cloud allows enterprises to:
                        <ul>
                            <li>access organiational data anywhere and at anytime</li>
                            <li>streamline IT operations</li>
                            <li>reduce the need for onsite IT equipment, maintenance and management</li>
                            <li>enable rapid responses to increasing data volume rquirements</li>
                        </ul>
                        One of the main disadvantages of using the cloud is that data could fall into the wrong hands and this could be used against the company. Therefore, companies must ensure that the data is heavily encrypted to ensure that it is secure.</p>

                <h3>Distributed processing</h3>
                    <p>Rather than the data being processed and analysed by big and powerful machines, <i>distribuuted data processing</i> takes the large volume of data and breaks it into smaller pieces.
                        These smaller data volumes are then distributed in many locations to be processed by many computers with smaller processors. The distributed file system locates files and moves data, but the users have no way of knowing
                        that the files are distributed among many differrent servers or nodes.
                        </p>

                <h3>Data Analysis</h3>
                    <p><i>Data analysis</i> is the process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming and modelling data to uncover useful data. Data analytics allows companies to understand the impact of their products and services better, and adjust
                        their methods and goals and also provide their customers with better products faster. Before analysing data, the company should know what information it is looking for and which problem they want to solve. This helps them
                        decide which type of analysis they require and the best tool to do this analysis. There are various applications for performing analysis.</p>
